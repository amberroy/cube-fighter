## Cube Fighter - A WebVR Game
Your mission: destroy all the cubes, armed with nothing but your mighty gaze cursor. Currently only one level, but position of cubes is randomly generated if you want to replay. AFAIK this is the World's First WebVR Game that runs on the Samsung Internet browser on Gear VR!
